Eran(Encrypted remote access node) is a free and opensource encryption messenger. The chats are encrypted in AES-256-bit. What makes Eran so special? And what does it differ from other encryption messenger?

So, we come to the points:

The key exchange between client and server is RSA 2048 bit encryption.
After the client and server have agreed on a key, followed by the communication features AES 256-bit encryption.
When a client receives contact with another client so a key exchange is performed within the encryption yet. After both clients have agreed on a key takes place between two additional encryption. I call this Double-Encryption. This is to ensure that the server or the provider can not monitor communications.
One can arbitrarily send many files, no matter the size. Each file will be encrypted completely, and here also the Double-Encryption.
You can send voice messages are also encrypted.
There are at the server no database / account system with which one can assign an account a user.
The server log any IPâ€™s or any information. There error messages are only stored by the server software.
We contacted other not via an e-mail or an IP but a so-called Eran address. The Eran address is composed of the user name, password and a generated text, which then SHA256bit value is determined. Subsequently, value is determined by the value of SHA256bit MD5. And it is then your Eran address together!
Now we come to the very particular point. And Although the Secure Desktop mode!

The Secure Desktop mode protects you from spyware or Trojan. While you are in the Secure Desktop mode includes Windows interfaces to intercept the keystrokes or picking up the screen.
